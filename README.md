This challenge was very interesting and fun, it had really interesting components. Although my site isn't pixel perfect, 
I still want to share what I built because even though I had an unexpected week and didn't have the time I wish I had, 
I invested a good amount of time on it. Some of the components are hidden because it looks better that way. I really enjoyed 
and learned a lot on this challange, and I am grateful for the opportunity, thanks.
